# Portuguese to Spanish VTT Translator

This project is a Python script that automatically translates VTT (WebVTT) subtitle files from Portuguese to Spanish using the Ollama AI model.

## Features

- Translates VTT files from Portuguese to Spanish
- Maintains original timestamp structure
- Adds timestamps to entries missing them
- Processes multiple VTT files in a directory

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Ollama installed and set up on your system
- The Llama2 13B model (or equivalent) available in your Ollama installation

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vtt-translator.git
cd vtt-translator

2. Install the required Python packages:

pip install ollama

## Usage

1. Place your Portuguese VTT files in the `./start-lang` directory.

2. Run the script:

python esp_trans.py

3. The translated Spanish VTT files will be saved in the same directory with the prefix `translated_es_`.

## Customization

- To change the input/output directory, modify the `folder_path` variable in the `__main__` section of the script.
- To use a different Ollama model, change the `model` parameter in the `ollama.generate()` function call.
